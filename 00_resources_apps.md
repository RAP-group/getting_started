# Applications/Programs

These are some programs that are useful for research, graduate school. The 
majority are for MAC OS, however, applications for windows and linux are also 
listed if I know about them.

## Text editors

Why do you need a text editor? The TL;DR is that they will save you time. A 
text editor is used to editing plain text files. If you use excel to do any 
data wrangling, you are doing it wrong. You should do this in R, but in some 
cases a good text editor is also necessary. Key features to look for include: 
multiple cursors, split-windows, and REPLs. 

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com): This is the text editor I use. 
It is proprietary software, but I believe it is a worthwhile investment. The 
trial version can be used indefinitely (but with annoying pop-ups). It is 
available on all platforms and is (as of Sept. 2018) still under active 
development. It can be expanded by downloading external packages. 
- [TextMate](https://macromates.com): About as good as Sublime Text, but free. 
The main drawback is that development has slowed down and it does not have 
split-windows. Mac only. Plug-ins are available. 
- [Atom](https://atom.io): Interesting, free alternative to the above editors. 
Atom is made by Github and has external package development. The main 
complaint is that Atom is significantly slower than other editors. 
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org): Windows only. I don't know much 
about this editor but it is popular amongst windows users. 
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org): Famous for being controlled by key combinations, 
vim is rather difficult to learn. People who invest the time (not me), swear 
by it. 
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io): I've never used brackets, but is has become 
a popular alternative to proprietary editors. Mac only. 
- [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/): Mac only, proprietary. 

## IDE's

IDE's (integrated development environments) are different from text editors in 
that they allow you to do much more. IDE's include text editors. They are kind 
of like a swiss army knife for development. An informative analogy that I read 
online once claims that having a good text editor (Sublime Text, for example) 
is like having a Ferrari, while having a good IDE is like having the factory 
that produces Ferrari's. Programming nerds fight over which is better.

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com): This is the development environment that 
RAP Group uses for the R programming language. It facilitates statistical 
analysis, but also plays a crucial role in making research reproducible. It 
can also be used to create websites, develop R packages, create webapps, and 
much more. 
- [EMACS](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): Similar to VIM regarding the 
learning curve and unusual key bindings. I used EMACS exclusively when I 
started grad school, but eventually switched to Sublime Text and RStudio. I 
wasted a lot of time customizing it. It was fun, but unproductive. Many people 
(still) swear by it.
