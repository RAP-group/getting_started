Useful information/resources to help new researchers get started.

## Resources

```{r, 'list-resources', results='asis', message=F, warning=F, echo=F}
library(dplyr)
files_vector <- list.files(".") %>% 
  as_tibble(.) %>% 
  filter(., !(value %in% c("getting_started.Rproj", "LICENSE", 
                           "README.md", "README.Rmd"))) %>% 
  pull(.)

list_names <- c(
  "Applications/programs", 
  "Open science/reproducible research", 
  "Project management", 
  "R", 
  "RMarkdown", 
  "Statistics", 
  "Praat", 
  "LaTeX", 
  "Regular expressions (regex)", 
  "HTML/CSS") 

names(files_vector) <- list_names

paste0("- [", names(files_vector), "](", files_vector, ") \n") %>% 
  cat(.)
```

## Some advice

Use the resources provided in this repo as they become necessary to you. Do 
not try to learn everything at once. You will be overwhelmed. Try to master 
the information over time as it becomes necessary in your research.
